# stm32f103-examples
Example programs for STM32F103 MCU

Few, often simple, programs to show how to use my `common_lib` and `device_lib` projects in real apps :)

If you would like to compile them by yourself, please check https://github.com/ObKo/stm32-cmake/tree/old-stdperiph repository for instructions how to set up your CMake toolchain
